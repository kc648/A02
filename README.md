PART 1: Directions on Using WebStorm

#1 - Download Git by going to https://git-scm.com/ and selecting their latest source release (2.51.0 for Windows).
#2 - Create a GitHub account using your NJIT student email.
#3 - Visit https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/ and request a license for the JETBRAINS Student Pack. **IMPORTANT: Make sure to use your NJIT student email when creating an account with them and applying for the license**
#4 -Once your license is verified, download the WebStorm application.
#5 - Open WebStorm and go through the installation wizard, keeping all of the settings at their defaults.
#6 - After WebStorm is successfully installed, open the application and display its settings (CTRL+ALT+S).
  #6a - On the side bar, select Version Control and then Git.
  #6b - Do a test on the path saved in the location box to ensure WebStorm and Git are linked successfully.
  #6c - On the side bar, select Version Control and then GitHub this time.
  #6d - Click on the "+" in the top right corner of GitHub page in WebStorm's settings.
  #6e - Select "Log In via GitHub" from the drop down.
  #6f - As it redirects you back to Google to login, make sure you use the same credentials as your NJIT account that you created earlier.
#7 - Select "Create New Project" on WebStorm's home page.
  #7a - Once again choose an easily accessible file location for your project and click "Create"
  #7b - 
#8 - Now, you have successfully connected your WebStorm to your local repository (Git) and your remote repository (GitHub).
#9 - To test out your new project environment's version control, we can create a HTML file in our new Project.
  #9a - Create the HTML file and add some random text inside.
#10 - When you create this new HTML file, a dialogue box should pop-up confirming whether or not you want to add the file to Git, select Add. This takes your local change and logs it until you are ready to commit all of your changes to your local repository with Git.
#11 - Now, if you wanted to be more redundant with your version control, you may want to push the commits from your local repository to your remote one with GitHub. To achieve this, select the three lines or "hamburger" icon on the top left corner of the WebStorm application and select Git from the toolbar.
  #11a - **IMPORTANT: Make sure you have created a new public repository in GitHub** 
  #11b - From the Git dropdown menu, check off all of the files that have recorded changes and select "Commit". Don't forget to leave a descriptive message on the changes or actions that were logged with this commit.
  #11c - Press "Commit and Push" after you have settled on a commit message.
  #11d - A dialogue should pop-up asking you to define the URL of your remote repository. Make sure you copy and paste the link of the public repository you made in GitHub previously.
  #11e - Hit "OK" and finally, select the "Push" button to push commits to remote repository.
